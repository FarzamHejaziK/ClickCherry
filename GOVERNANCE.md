# Governance

## Model

This project currently follows a BDFL-style governance model:

- The project owner has final decision authority on roadmap, architecture, and merges.
- Contributions are welcome from everyone.

## Maintainers

Current maintainer roles are listed in `/MAINTAINERS.md`.

## Pull Request Authority

- All PRs require maintainer review.
- Branch protection should require owner approval before merge.
- Required status checks must pass before merge.

## Evolution

As the project grows, this file may transition to area maintainers and delegated
review ownership via `CODEOWNERS`.
