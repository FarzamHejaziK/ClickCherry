# Agent Instructions

- At the beginning of any task, read all the docs in `.docs/` first.
- Testing strategy: at each incremental implementation step, verify with both automated code-based tests and manual tests before marking the step complete.
- Keep a running implementation log in `.docs/worklog.md`.
- Always plan upcoming work in `.docs/next_steps.md`.
